# Git commits style
1) ADD: a list of new files — description of added functionality
    ```
    ADD: authorize.py - add google auth
    ```
2) UPDATE: list of changed files (most important) — list of changes
    ```
    UPDATE: aythorize.py — change google auth to discord, delete get_ip method
    ```
3) DELETE: list of deleted files (most important) — reason
    ```
    DELETE: aythorize.py — it's deprecated logic
    ```
4) FIX: bug name — describe reason
    ```
    FIX: discord auth cycle — invalid token
    ```
5) RELEASE: version — most changes
    ```
    RELEASE: v0.1.2 — add (discord, google auth), improve load perfomance
    ```

### Recommendations
1) 1 action = 1 commit
2) More commits are better than none
3) Commit must not include many changes
4) Good commit name helps avoid confusion
